Machine Learning Internship Projects â€“ Coding Samurai

Welcome to the official repository of my Machine Learning internship projects completed under the guidance of Coding Samurai. This internship focused on applying core ML techniques to real-world problems, helping bridge the gap between academic concepts and industry use cases.

The projects cover a range of ML domains, including regression, classification, natural language processing, and deep learning.
